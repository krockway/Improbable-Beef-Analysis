# Improbable-Beef-Analysis

## Project Overview
Improbable Beef is interested in proteins that taste like beef; other labs have had success synthesizing meat from algae, bacteria and fungi found on plant roots. Roza and her team have partnered with Improbable Beef to research alternative candidate species.

The human body is a source of thousands of types of bacteria and Roza suspects that the perfect missing protein may come from bacteria found in human belly buttons. To test her hypothesis, Roza has sampled the navels of participants across the country to identify different bacteria types.

In the dashboards below are her findings.

Each participant shown is anonymous; participants have been supplied with an ID number to identify themselves & their personal bacteria analysis. Scientists and researchers can use the anonymous data for further research.

## Dashboard Summary: 

The dashboard features 3 charts, each of which are interactive based on the selection from the dropdown menu. Additionally, the demographic information will dynamically update as each user is selected.

### 1. Horizontal bar chart
The horizontal bar chart displays the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) for a given individual.

### 2. Gauge chart
The gauge chart displays the frequency which the user washes their belly button.

### 3. Bubble chart
The bubble chart displays the bacteria IDs along the x-axis and the sample values along the y-axis. The size of the bubble is dictated by the sample value and the color is dictated by the bacteria IDs.
