# Improbable-Beef-Analysis

## Project Overview
Improbable Beef is interested in proteins that taste like beef; other labs have had success synthesizing meat from algae, bacteria and fungi found on plant roots. Roza and her team have partnered with Improbable Beef to research alternative candidate species.

The human body is a source of thousands of types of bacteria and Roza suspects that the perfect missing protein may come from bacteria found in human belly buttons. To test her hypothesis, Roza has sampled the navels of participants across the country to identify different bacteria types.

In the dashboards below are her findings.

Each participant shown is anonymous; participants have been supplied with an ID number to identify themselves & their personal bacteria analysis. Scientists and researchers can use the anonymous data for further research.
